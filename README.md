###Change
This project is forked from [youngshook/PokemonHook](https://github.com/youngshook/PokemonHook). I change the fuction of the setting button to switch the hidden value of direction buttons.

###How to install 

0. Install Xcode from Apple Store. (at least 7.0)
1. Unzip "adr'sPokemonGo.zip" and get the "pokemongo.app" that I build.
2. Sign "pokemongo.app" with your signature (Using [iResign](https://github.com/maciekish/iReSign), [iOS App Signer](https://dantheman827.github.io/ios-app-signer/), etc.) and you will get a ipa file.
3. Install your ipa file with iTune or XCode.
4. Have fun!
